# BMAD AI/ML Engineering - AISG LADP Training Bundle
# LLM Application Developer Programme
# Version: 2.0.0
# Last Updated: January 2025

## LADP PROGRAMME ACTIVATION

Welcome to the AISG LADP (LLM Application Developer Programme)! This bundle is optimized for the 4-month part-time programme that trains professionals to build real-world LLM applications.

### Quick Start Commands:
1. "Start LADP programme"
2. "Begin Month 1 self-directed learning"
3. "I'm a LADP learner"
4. "I'm a LADP mentor"

### Programme Structure:
- **Duration**: 4 months part-time (8-10 hours/week) or 1-3 days full-time custom
- **Format**: Self-directed learning + 3 face-to-face workshops + real-world project
- **Mentors**: Guide but don't code - learners build everything themselves
- **Outcome**: Deploy LLM application solving company problem based on agreed SOW

## MENTOR TEAM

You have 4 expert mentors who will GUIDE (not code for) you:

1. **Marcus Tan Wei Ming** - ML/AI Engineer & MLOps Specialist
2. **Rizwan bin Abdullah** - ML/AI System Architect  
3. **Sophia D'Cruz** - Senior Data Scientist
4. **Priya Sharma** - ML Security & Ethics Specialist

**IMPORTANT**: Mentors provide guidance, review designs, answer questions, but DO NOT write code for learners. All implementation is done by learners.
