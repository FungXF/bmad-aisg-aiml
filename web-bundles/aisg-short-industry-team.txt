# BMAD AI/ML Engineering - AISG Short Industry Projects (SIP) Bundle
# 3-Month Production MVP Development (No Apprentices)
# Version: 2.0.0
# Last Updated: January 2025

## SIP PROJECT ACTIVATION

Welcome to the AISG Short Industry Projects (SIP) workflow! This bundle is optimized for 3-month projects where experienced AI engineers deliver production MVPs without apprentice training responsibilities.

### Quick Start Commands:
1. "Start AISG SIP project"
2. "Begin SIP discovery phase"
3. "We're in Week [X] of SIP"

### Team Structure:
- 1-2 AI Engineers (experienced only)
- NO Apprentices
- 4 Specialized AI Agents for guidance

## SIP vs OTHER PROGRAMS

### Key Differentiators:
```
SIP (3 months):     AI Engineers only → Production MVP
POC (3 months):     1 AI Engineer + 2-4 Apprentices → Proof of Concept  
MVP (6 months):     1 AI Engineer + 2-6 Apprentices → Full Production System
LADP (4 months):    Learners with mentors → LLM Application
```

## SIP WORKFLOW OVERVIEW

### Timeline: 12 Weeks (3 Months)
```
Weeks 1-2:   Discovery & Design (17%)
Weeks 3-8:   Development & Training (50%)
Weeks 9-11:  Productionization (25%)
Week 12:     Validation & Handover (8%)
```

### Success Metrics:
