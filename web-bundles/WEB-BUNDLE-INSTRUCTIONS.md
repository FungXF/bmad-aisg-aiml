## How to Use Web Bundles

### Method 1: Direct Copy-Paste

1. **Open the bundle file** in any text editor
2. **Select all content** (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
3. **Copy the content** (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
4. **Open your AI platform** (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, etc.)
5. **Paste the bundle** into the chat
6. **Send the message**
7. **The AI will confirm** activation of the BMAD framework

### Method 2: File Upload (if supported)

1. **Download the bundle** (.txt file)
2. **Open your AI platform**
3. **Click the attachment/upload button**
4. **Select the bundle file**
5. **Add instruction**: "Load this BMAD framework"
6. **Send the message**

### Method 3: Multi-Part Loading (for size limits)

If the platform has character limits:

1. **Split the bundle** at logical sections
2. **Send Part 1** with: "This is part 1 of BMAD framework, acknowledge and wait"
3. **Wait for confirmation**
4. **Send remaining parts** sequentially
5. **Final message**: "All parts loaded, activate BMAD framework"

## Platform-Specific Instructions

### Claude.ai (Anthropic)

```
1. Open claude.ai
2. Start new conversation
3. Paste entire bundle
4. Claude will recognize the framework
5. Begin with: "I need help with [your AI/ML task]"
```

**Tips for Claude**:
- Supports large context (200K tokens)
- Can handle entire bundle in one message
- Excellent at following structured frameworks
- Use Projects feature for persistent access

### ChatGPT (OpenAI)

```
1. Open chat.openai.com
2. Use GPT-4 for best results
3. Paste bundle or upload file
4. Start with: "Using this framework, help me with..."
```

**Tips for ChatGPT**:
- GPT-4 has 128K context window
- Can save as Custom GPT for reuse
- Good at maintaining agent personas
- Use Code Interpreter for execution

### Google Gemini

```
1. Open gemini.google.com

- Good integration with Google Workspace

### Local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio)

```
1. Load your preferred model
2. Paste bundle in system prompt
3. Or save as context file
4. Reference in conversations
```

**Tips for Local**:
- Adjust for model context limits
- Save as system prompt for persistence
- Consider using RAG for large bundles
- Test with smaller sections first

## Activation Commands

Once loaded, use these commands to activate specific features:

### Agent Activation
```
"Activate Marcus for ML engineering"
"Switch to Rizwan for architecture"
"Use Sophia for data analysis"
"Get Priya for security review"
```

### Workflow Activation
```
"Start AISG MVP workflow"      (6-month with apprentices)
"Begin POC project"            (3-month with apprentices)
"Launch SIP project"           (3-month no apprentices)
"Start LADP programme"         (4-month LLM training)
```

### Quick Commands
```
"@marcus" - Activate Marcus (ML Engineer)
"@rizwan" - Activate Rizwan (Architect)
"@sophia" - Activate Sophia (Data Scientist)
"@priya" - Activate Priya (Security/Ethics)
"Show agents" - List all available agents
"Where are we?" - Check current status
```

## Program-Specific Commands

### For MVP (6-month):
```
"We're in Week [1-24] of MVP"
"Start Phase 2 experimentation"
"Begin productionization phase"
```

### For POC (3-month):
```
"Week [1-12] of POC"
"Start rapid discovery"
"Move to prototyping"
```

### For SIP (3-month):
```
"Week [1-12] of SIP"
"No apprentices, just engineers"
"Focus on MVP delivery"
```

### For LADP (4-month):
```
"Month [1-4] of LADP"
"I'm a learner needing guidance"
"Workshop [1/2/3] preparation"
```

## Bundle Customization

### Creating Custom Bundles

You can create custom bundles by combining sections:

```python
# Example: Create a security-focused bundle
custom_bundle = """
# BMAD AI/ML Security Bundle
# Include only security-relevant agents

## AGENTS
[Copy Marcus, Priya sections]

## SECURITY WORKFLOWS
[Copy security workflows]

## SECURITY CHECKLISTS
[Copy security checklists]
"""
```

### Trimming Bundles

For platforms with smaller context windows:

1. **Remove examples** - Keep core instructions
2. **Condense descriptions** - Shorter agent intros
3. **Focus workflows** - Include only needed phases
4. **Minimize templates** - Essential templates only

### Adding Context

Enhance bundles with project-specific context:

```
# Project Context (Add to bundle)
PROJECT: Customer Churn Prediction
COMPANY: TechCorp Singapore
TIMELINE: 3 months
CONSTRAINTS: On-premise deployment only
TEAM SIZE: 2 engineers (no apprentices - use SIP)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Session Management

- **Save conversations** for reference
- **Export successful sessions** as templates
- **Document agent interactions** that work well
- **Create conversation bookmarks** at key points

### 2. Context Optimization

- **Start with clear objectives**: "I need to build X for Y"
- **Specify your program**: "We're doing a 3-month SIP"
- **Provide context upfront**: Industry, constraints, timeline
- **Reference bundle sections**: "Using the SIP workflow..."
- **Maintain conversation focus**: One objective per session

### 3. Agent Coordination

- **Sequential activation**: Complete one agent's task before switching
- **Explicit handoffs**: "Now switch to Marcus for deployment"
- **Team reviews**: "Get input from Sophia and Rizwan"
- **Clear transitions**: "Moving to Phase 2 with Marcus"

### 4. Program Selection

Choose the right program bundle:
- **Have apprentices to train?** → Use MVP (6-month) or POC (3-month)
- **Need fast MVP, no training?** → Use SIP (3-month)
- **Learning LLM development?** → Use LADP (4-month)
- **Just need AI/ML help?** → Use Full Team bundle

### 5. Troubleshooting

**If agents don't activate:**
```
"Please acknowledge you've loaded the BMAD framework"
"Show me the available agents"
"Activate the Data Scientist agent from the framework"
```

**If context is lost:**
```
"Remember you're acting as [Agent Name]"
"We're in Phase 2 of the SIP workflow"
"Continue with the task from the framework"
```

**If responses are generic:**
```
"Use the specific approach from the BMAD framework"
"Follow the SIP workflow for Week [X]"
"Apply the template provided in the framework"
```

## Advanced Usage

### 1. Multi-Bundle Combinations

Load multiple bundles for complex projects:

```
1. Load core BMAD bundle
2. Load AI/ML expansion bundle
3. Add domain-specific bundle
4. Result: Comprehensive framework
```

### 2. Progressive Enhancement

Start simple, add complexity:

```
Session 1: Load POC bundle for validation
Session 2: If successful, upgrade to SIP for MVP
Session 3: Later expand to full MVP with apprentices
```

### 3. Team Collaboration

Share bundles across team:

```
1. Standardize on specific bundle version
2. Create team-specific customizations
3. Document successful patterns
4. Share conversation templates
```

### 4. Automation Integration

Use with automation tools:

```python
# Example: Automated bundle loading via API
import openai

def load_bmad_bundle(client, bundle_path):
    with open(bundle_path, 'r') as f:
        bundle_content = f.read()
    
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": bundle_content},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Acknowledge BMAD framework loaded"}
        ]
    )
    return response
```

## Bundle Maintenance

### Version Control

- Keep bundles in Git repository
- Tag versions for stability
- Document changes in CHANGELOG
- Test before deployment

### Updates

When framework updates:

1. Download latest bundle
2. Diff with current version
3. Test in isolated session
4. Deploy to team when verified

### Feedback Loop

Improve bundles based on usage:

1. Collect user feedback
2. Document common issues
3. Refine activation commands
4. Enhance problem sections
