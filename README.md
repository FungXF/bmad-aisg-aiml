# BMAD AI/ML Engineering Expansion Pack (v2.0 - Streamlined)

This expansion pack extends the BMAD Method framework to support AI/ML engineering projects with a streamlined, consolidated architecture that reduces complexity while maintaining full capabilities.

## 🚀 Accelerated AI-Driven Delivery

With modern agentic AI frameworks like BMAD, we've revolutionized project delivery:
- **Traditional Timeline**: 6-12 months → **BMAD Timeline**: 3-12 weeks
- **Higher Quality**: AI agents ensure consistent best practices
- **Faster Iteration**: Rapid prototyping and testing cycles
- **Continuous Delivery**: Deploy multiple times per day, not per quarter

## Overview

The streamlined AI/ML Engineering expansion pack provides specialized agents, workflows, templates, and best practices for:

- Machine Learning model development and deployment
- Large Language Model (LLM) and RAG application development
- Comprehensive MLOps pipeline implementation
- Unified AI security, ethics, and governance
- Data science and analytics workflows
- AI Singapore program-specific workflows
