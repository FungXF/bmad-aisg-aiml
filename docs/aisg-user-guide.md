2. **Follow Phases**: Respect the workflow phases
   - Discovery ‚Üí Development ‚Üí Deployment ‚Üí Validation

3. **Document Everything**: Agents maintain comprehensive documentation
   - Model cards, architecture docs, runbooks

4. **Test Thoroughly**: Use checklists before production
   - ML readiness, ethics, security, MLOps

5. **Consider Ethics**: Always include responsible AI practices
   - Bias checking, fairness evaluation, compliance

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding?
- Ensure proper activation command
- Check if previous task is complete
- Try explicit activation: "Switch to [Agent Name] now"

### Workflow Confusion?
- State program type clearly: "AISG MVP project"
- Specify current phase: "We're in experimentation phase"
- Request workflow status: "Where are we in the workflow?"

### Task Not Found?
- List available tasks: "[Agent], show your tasks"
- Check agent capabilities: "What can [Agent] do?"
- Request task list: "Show all ML engineering tasks"
